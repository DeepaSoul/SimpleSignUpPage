# SimpleSignUpPage
A sign up and sign in page created with Html, CSS and JavaScript.

### Routing: 
The app automatically loads on the Sign up page, on its right hand side the Sign In button can be pressed to access the Sign In page, equally with the sign in page.

The project is currently very much geared to running locally on the machine. Prefferably a library like React would've been more better for the validation and handling the forms with their corresponding API's. 

Used normal HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript due its light weight as opposed to a library especially since no scripting apart from animation and validation.
